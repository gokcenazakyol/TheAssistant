# The Assistant 👩🏽‍💻

- Virtual assistants have become a ubiquitous feature of modern life, with platforms such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant providing users with a wide range of functionalities and conveniences. 
- However, one major issue with these virtual assistants is the lack of customization and personalization options available to users. While these platforms are capable of performing a variety of tasks, they often do so in a uniform and impersonal manner, leaving users feeling disconnected from the technology they are interacting with.
- The aim of this project is to address this problem by developing a virtual assistant that is more interactive and personalized, with a focus on creating a more natural and engaging user experience.
